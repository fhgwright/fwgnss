# End of validity for current tai-utc.dat (here)

# This is now set to be five months after the date referenced in
# IERS Bulletin C, and hence one month prior to the next potential leap
# second following the one referenced in that document.  This provides
# a reasonable amount of time for an update, while stopping short of
# the unknown leap second.

# IERS Bulletin C #68 states no leap second on 2024-Dec-31.
